Official Code For [TDEER: An Efficient Translating Decoding Schema for Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.635/)

## Overview

TDEER is an efficient model for joint extraction of entities and relations. Unlike the common decoding approach that predicts the relation between subject and object, we adopt the proposed translating decoding schema: subject + relation -> objects, to decode triples. By the proposed translating decoding schema, TDEER can handle the overlapping triple problem effectively and efficiently. The following figure is an illustration of our models.
